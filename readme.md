# Multi-Note

### A easy and logical way of keeping track of the those pesky life goals and irritating day to day tasks!

Multi note came out of a need to keep up my work and motivation while searching for my first Dev job. I found myself using a mismatch of reminders, notes and calender apps to try do this. However, being the over busy type i constantly forgot important bits of info by simple forgetting to regularly check each app. 
  So i thought to myself, why not slap all the best from each one into one place, while also expanding my technical skills! So thats what ive been trying to do.

## Usage
 i hope soon to host this somewhere, but in the meantime heres how to host it locally.

 clone both repos into separate folders.
 ```linux
  git clone https://github.com/ruben-wilson/Multi-Note-front-end.git
  git clone https://github.com/ruben-wilson/Multi-Note-Backend.git
 ```

install dependencies for both.
```linux
  npm i 
```

start both builds 
```linux
  npm run build
```

On the front-end open index.html in your browser
```linux
  open index.html
```

## Design process 

I've worked on this over a couple weeks on my own. Despite working on my own i still kept a trello to keep track of tasks and try focus myself.[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/wYPequ14/tasks-app)
